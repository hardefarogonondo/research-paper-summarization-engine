## SciTLDR: Extreme Summarization of Scientific Documents

SciTLDR is a new multi-target dataset of 5.4K TLDRs over 3.2K papers. SciTLDR contains both author-written and expert-derived TLDRs, where the latter are collected using a novel annotation protocol that produces high-quality summaries while minimizing annotation burden. This dataset has been used in the research paper titled **TLDR: Extreme Summarization of Scientific Documents** authored by Isabel Cachola, Kyle Lo, Arman Cohan, Daniel S. Weld.
